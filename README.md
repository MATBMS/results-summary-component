### What I learned

This project demonstrates the use of CSS linear-gradient to create visually appealing gradient effects. It has been a great learning exercise to understand and apply the linear-gradient property in web development.

The linear-gradient property allows for smooth transitions between two or more colors, which can be applied to backgrounds or other elements to enhance aesthetics.

Through this project, I have learned how to effectively use linear-gradient to improve the design and user experience of web applications.

```css
.blue-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #7755ff 0%, #6943ff 0%, #2f2ce9 100%);
}
```
